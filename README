#+TITLE: fdroid.el
=fdroid.el= is an Emacs interface to [[https://f-droid.org/][F-Droid]]. Its purpose is to aid in the management of F-Droid packages for an Android device or an emulator inside the comfort of Emacs.

* Installation
To install the package manually, simply point to the checkout in your =load-path=.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/fdroid.el")
#+end_src

Alternatively, if you want to get a development environment set up quickly, it's suggested you install a package manager such as [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] or [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] and start developing on the local package checkout with these commands:

For GNU Guix:

#+begin_src sh
guix shell --pure
#+end_src

For Nix:

#+begin_src sh
nix develop
#+end_src

Since this package leverages the [[https://github.com/mvdan/fdroidcl][fdroidcl]] F-Droid desktop client for most of its functionality, it's necessary for you to have it installed too. If it's your first time using =fdroidcl=, ensure to download the F-Droid repository index first via the =M-x fdroid-update= command.

* Usage
An example =fdroid.el= configuration might look like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c f") 'fdroid-map)
(with-eval-after-load 'fdroid
  (setq fdroid-log-events t)
  (setq fdroid-sans-device t))
#+end_src

Above, we set a global binding for the =fdroid-map= and modify a couple of settings which control the verbosity of =fdroidcl= commands and whether we can run commands without a connected device.

To show all packages available in the current F-Droid repositories you can run the =fdroid-list-packages= command. You can then invoke the interactive commands set below or, if you have the [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] package installed, the corresponding Embark actions on the mini-buffer targets:

- =fdroid-install= (~i~) :: install the current package.
- =fdroid-uninstall= (~u~) :: uninstall the current package.
- =fdroid-download= (~d~) :: download the current package.
- =fdroid-show= (~s~) :: show more information about the current package.
